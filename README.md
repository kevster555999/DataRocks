# DataRocks - Google Street View Image Character Recognition With Julia
Final Project Proposal for ORIE 4741
Kevin Huang (kh522), Xinran Pan (xp33), and Francis Yih (fy36)

Description: Our final project proposal is to use a dataset that we found on www.kaggle.com that has images from Google StreetView of characters. We intend to see if we can figure out which picture corresponds to which character, and in training a model to do so , see if we can use this generalized image classification method on other instances, like captcha. We could also extend this model to do help with computer vision problems, such as reading traffic signs, store names and other various things that may be useful.

RE: Project Proposal

  The DataRocks division is proud to introduce a proposal which will bring untold benefits to the company. We believe that by analyzing pictures taken from Google's StreetView (generously provided to us by Kaggle), we can create a classifier which takes images as an input and text as an output. This is a great opportunity which we should seize in order to get an edge on the market. By being able to answer the simple question of "What is that picture saying?", we can serve our clients in new and innovative ways. The applications and their importance are numerous. We can quickly put together a database of local businesses, resturants, and hospitals, and schools. We can help create more accurate, real time mapping systems through detecting traffic signals and detour signs. The success of this project can allow the company to come up with a faster and more acurate optical character recognition classifier. 
  
  We plan on utlizing various techniques learned in class to make sense of the data. We analyze if there are any patterns within the pixel values that corresponds to actual patterns in the image, or see if different clusters of pixels have a correlation with diffent similar features of an image. Furthermore, the data that we obtain from the Kaggle's datasets is theoretically already clean (there should be no missing pixels), and will help smooth the process of finding a way of classifying these images.
  
  We also plan on researching techniques that are commonly used amongst other data specialists and see whether or not we can incorporate them in order to better train our model. Better yet, we may even draw inspiration from different models currently used and come up with a new technique in our classifier. By incorporating multiple ideas drawn from different sources as well as having creative feature engineering, we can maximize our probability for success.
  
  We hope to work on this project for the rest of the year and commit to creating a classifier. As such, at the end of this semester, we will deliver a report detailing our results, problems, and solutions. We sincerely believe this venture is worth the time and effort put in, and that results will transoform our company. 
  
  Sincerely,
